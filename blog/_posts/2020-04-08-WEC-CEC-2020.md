Recently, my paper titled **WEC: Weighted Ensemble of text Classifiers** got accepted for oral presentation at the IEEE's CEC 2020. 

**(This blog is under development)**

<!--more-->

The paper presents an idea of applying weighted ensemble to a combination of different classifiers consisting several learning algorithms and text representations. This posts aim is to explain the approach in a more simpler way rather than the scientific way.

**Introduction**

Motivation and idea behind WEC.

**Literature Gap**

Why WEC?

**Proposed Framework**

Framework for training.

**Experimental Setup**

Dataset and algorithms used. Hyperparameter settings.

**Results**
