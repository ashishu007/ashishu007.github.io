On 28th August 2020, my alma-mater, [IIIT Naya Raipur](https://www.iiitnr.ac.in/) organised **3rd Annual Industry Academia Meet**. This year, for the first time they introduced a special session on **Carrer Guidance from Alumni** for the current students. I am very lucky for being invited to talk about my research and guide other students for career in Machine Learning. This blog is a summary of that talk.

## Business Processes

## Machine Learning

## Labelled Data

## Active Learning

## Closing Notes
Finally, I would like to re-iterate few things here:

- Thumb rule of Machine Learning: 
    - Data first, algorithm next
    - Always try Active Learning for manual labelling

- Data preparation on your resume
    - Always set you aside from the crowd

- Must Read:
    - Burr Settles'Â [Active learning literature survey](http://burrsettles.com/pub/settles.activelearning.pdf)

Here are the slides from my talk.
