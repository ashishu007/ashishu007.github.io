On 28th August 2020, my alma-mater, [IIIT Naya Raipur](https://www.iiitnr.ac.in/) (IIITNR) organised **3rd Annual Industry Academia Meet (IAM)**. This year, they introduced a special session on **Carrer Guidance from Alumni** for the current students. I feel honoured for being invited to talk about my research and guide other students for career in Machine Learning. This blog is a written version of that talk.

IAM at IIITNR is a great intiative started in 2017 where different personalities from IT Indsustry are invited to interact with the students of IIITNR. They deliver special lectures, talk about their work in the industry, judge different student competitions, and most importantly - guide the students on being *industry-ready*.

## Introduction
The topic of my talk was **Machine Learning (ML) for Business Processes (BP)**. There are many reasons for choosing this topic: first, ML has reached that stage where models are being deployed in real world, but they still face problems related to labelled data which is expensive to get; second, this is what I worked on during my final semester internship at RGU and am working in my PhD.

## About the Talk
In this talk, I motivated the students to focus on efficient ways of gathering data in ML ecosystem before going into the learning algorithms. I also gave an example on how to use one such method, **Active Learning (AL)**, for a classification problem. In short, AL is a method where learning algorithms are allowed to choose the data from which they learn, hence achieving greater accuracy with fewer training labels available.

In this digital-era, although the demand for **Data Scientists** is high, but we can't ignore the fact that supply is also not low. Thus, I wanted to draw the attention of students towards working on real-world ecosystem for ML problems. Afterall, having some experience in **Low Resoucre for ML** is always going to set them aside from the crowd.

Here are the slides from my talk.
