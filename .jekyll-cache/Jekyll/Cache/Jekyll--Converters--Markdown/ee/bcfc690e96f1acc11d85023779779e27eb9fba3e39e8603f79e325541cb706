I"<p>The chatbot that you’re using does not store any personal data. It is simply part of a machine learning project that I am doing for fun. The basic idea is that the chatbot is trained on my social media conversations, and should hopefully respond to messages the way that I do.</p>

<p>There’s no storing of personal information, no ads that will be sent to you, no promotional content, no selling of services, and no requesting of financial information.</p>
