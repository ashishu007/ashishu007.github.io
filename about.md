## Non-Academic Interests and Achievements

During my Bachelor studies, I was involved into a lot of event organising, to name a few: Connaissance 2016 (Litrature-cum-Cultural Fest, IIIT-NR), Technovate 2018 (Techno-Cultural Fest, IIIT-NR), Industry-Academia Meet, 2017 (IIIT-NR). Before 3rd year of my BTech degree, I also used to participate in a lot of Youth Parliaments where once I won the best delegate award as well. I charied a few debates as moderator and speaker (more about them in my <a href="https://panditu2015.github.io/CV_Ashish_Upadhyay.pdf">CV</a>).
