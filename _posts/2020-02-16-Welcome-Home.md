### Summary 
I am Ashish, first year PhD student based at the <a href="http://www.comp.rgu.ac.uk/">**Smart Data Technologies Centre,**</a> <a href="https://www.rgu.ac.uk/">**Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, UK**</a> working under the supervision of <a href="https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/massie-stewart">Dr. Stewart Massie</a> and <a href="https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/wiratunga-nirmalie">Prof. Nirmalie Wiratunga</a> in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). My research interest includes the use of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Deep Learning (DL) in NLP, especially finding ways to develop effective NLP systems for business processes with minimal labelled data. 

### About PhD Goal
The main goal of my PhD research is to develop hybrid techniques using CBR and DL for Natural Language Generation (NLG) with a focus on **data-to-text generation** tasks. I am also interested in the reverse engineering aspect of data-to-text generation task, where using different Information Extraction (IE) techniques we need to develop an initial knowledge base of a structured representation extracted from unlablled texts/documnets.

### Education
* **Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Artificial Intelligence (AI)** _{October 2019 - Ongoing}_
	- School of Computing Science and Digital Media, <a href="https://www.rgu.ac.uk/">Robert Gordon University</a> (RGU), Aberdeen, UK
	- Research Goal: Natural Language Generation from Structured Representations in Cold-Start Scenario

* **Bachelor's in Technology (BTech) in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)** _{August 2015 - June 2019}_
	- Department of Computer Science and Engineering, <a href="https://www.iiitnr.ac.in/">Dr. SPM-International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur</a> (IIIT-NR), Chhattisgarh, India
	- Thesis Title: Information Extraction and Requirement Mapping in Regulatory Documents 


### Before PhD
<!-- I completed my Bachelor's in Technology (BTech) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in June 2019 from <a href="https://www.iiitnr.ac.in/">Dr. SPM-International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur</a> (IIIT-NR), Chhattisgarh, India.  -->

Before starting the PhD at RGU, I also worked as an intern during my BTech final semester under the supervision of Dr. Stewart Massie at RGU. During that internship, I worked on a project of **Information Extraction and Requirement Mapping from Regulatory Documents**. It was an Oil and Gas Innovation Centre (OGIC) funded project in collaboration with an Aberdeen based start-up working on the automation of compliance management in Oil and Gas industry. This project outcome finally led to me getting a PhD offer under the same supervisor at RGU.
