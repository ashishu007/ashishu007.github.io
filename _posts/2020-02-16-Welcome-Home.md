<!-- ## Short-Intro  -->
I am Ashish, a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.comp.rgu.ac.uk/">School of Computing</a>, <a href="https://www.rgu.ac.uk/">Robert Gordon University</a>, Aberdeen, UK, working under the supervision of <a href="https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/massie-stewart">Dr. Stewart Massie</a> and <a href="https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/wiratunga-nirmalie">Prof. Nirmalie Wiratunga</a> in the field of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. 

I am interested in developing **Deep Learning** systems for **Natural Language Processing** tasks with a focus on low data requirement for training. In my PhD, I am exploring the possibility of developing accurate and scalable **Data-to-Text Generation** systems using Hybrid Traditional and Deep Learning systems. 

<!-- My research interest includes the use of **Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** in NLP, especially finding ways to develop effective NLG systems for business processes with minimal labelled data.  -->

<!-- In my PhD, I am interested to develop novel techniques for **data-to-text generation** tasks, with a focus on the data related problems faced by the business processes. -->

<!-- ## PhD Goal
The main goal of my PhD is to develop hybrid techniques using CBR and DL for Natural Language Generation (NLG) with a focus on **data-to-text generation** tasks. I am also interested in the reverse engineering aspect of data-to-text generation task, where using different Information Extraction (IE) techniques we need to develop an initial case-base of a structured representation extracted from unlablled texts/documnets. -->

## Research Interests

- Natural Language Processing
- Machine Learning

<!-- ### Before PhD -->
<!-- I completed my Bachelor's in Technology (BTech) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in June 2019 from <a href="https://www.iiitnr.ac.in/">Dr. SPM-International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur</a> (IIIT-NR), Chhattisgarh, India.  -->

<!-- Before starting the PhD at RGU, I also worked as an intern here during my BTech final semester under the supervision of Dr. Stewart Massie. During that internship, I worked on a project of **Information Extraction and Requirement Mapping from Regulatory Documents** which was also my bachelor's thesis. It was an Oil and Gas Innovation Centre (OGIC) funded project in collaboration with an Aberdeen based start-up working on the automation of compliance management in Oil and Gas industry. This project outcome finally led to me getting a PhD offer under the same supervisor at RGU. -->

<!-- ### Hobbies

I like reading, watching (on YouTube) about world's political history. It fascinates me - seeing how man-made lines on the globe (aka **borders**) change everytime - but the culture remains intact. I come from the beautiful land of India located in the Indian subcontinent consisting seven different countries. Its amazing as well as sad to know that how all these countries have shared cultural and political history, still divided through international borders. 

India, itself is a union of several cultures and stands on the principle of **unity in diversity**. Although, its sad to see that the Indian subcontinent is not a single country, I would love to see these countries forming an union similar to the EU. I know it seems highly unlikely on the basis of today's scenarios, but Europe before WW-II was way worse than the subcontinent today.  -->
