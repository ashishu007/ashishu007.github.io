## About Me

I am Ashish, first year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.rgu.ac.uk/">Robert Gordon University</a> (RGU), Aberdeen, UK working under the supervision of <a href="https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/massie-stewart">Dr. Stewart Massie</a> and <a href="https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/wiratunga-nirmalie">Prof. Nirmalie Wiratunga</a> in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). My research interest includes the use of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Deep Learning (DL) in NLP, especially finding ways to develop effective NLP systems for business processes with minimal labelled data. My research motive is to develop hybrid techniques using CBR and DL for Natural Language Generation (NLG) with a focus on **data-to-text generation** tasks.

I completed my Bachelor's in Technology (BTech) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in June 2019 from <a href="https://www.iiitnr.ac.in/">Dr. SPM-International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur</a> (IIIT-NR), Chhattisgarh, India. 

Before starting the PhD at RGU, I also worked as an intern during my BTech final semester under the supervision of Dr. Stewart Massie at RGU. During that internship, I worked on the Information Extraction and Requirement Mapping from Regulatory Documents. It was an Scottish Oil and Gas Innovation Centre (OGIC) funded project in collaboration with a Scotland based start-up working on the automation of compliance management in Oil and Gas industry. This project outcome finally led to me getting a PhD offer under the same supervisor at RGU.

## Non-Academic Interests and Achievements

During my Bachelor studies, I was involved into a lot of event organising, to name a few: Connaissance 2016 (Litrature-cum-Cultural Fest, IIIT-NR), Technovate 2018 (Techno-Cultural Fest, IIIT-NR), Industry-Academia Meet, 2017 (IIIT-NR). Before the start of 5th semester, I also used to participate in a lot of Youth Parliaments where once I won the best delegate award as well. I charied a few debates as moderator and speaker (more about them in my <a href="https://panditu2015.github.io/CV_Ashish_Upadhyay.pdf">CV</a>).
