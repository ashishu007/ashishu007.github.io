## About Me

Hello World! I'm Kushashwa Ravi Shrimali, Final Year Undergraduate at International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur with major in Computer Science and Engineering. I've previously worked at the ROSE Labs, NTU Singapore (Object Detection) and with US based Startup, Big Vision LLC and LearnOpenCV under mentorship of Dr. Satya Mallick. I am interested in Computer Vision and Deep Learning with an ink of development. 

I am currently open to 6 Month Internship Opportunities and my near goal is to do a Ph.D. in the field of Computer Vision.

Please navigate to <a href="https://krshrimali.github.io/pytorch/">PyTorch</a> or <a href="https://krshrimali.github.io/opencv/">OpenCV</a> section of this blog to read my blogs.

## Work Experience

- **Rapid Rich Object Search (ROSE) Labs, NTU Singapore** 
    - On-site internship at ROSE Labs, NTU Singapore under Prof. Alex Kot (Director, ROSE Labs). Worked on Automatic License Plate Recognition technique in real time using PyTorch in both C++ and Python. Used YOLO based network and achieved 85% accuracy for Single Line License Plates and Double Line License Plates (tested on real time dataset of Singaporean Vehicles).
- **Big Vision LLC and LearnOpenCV, California**
	- Worked from home in writing blogs and working for clients for Big Vision LLC. Became OpenCV Contributor during my internship, and worked on several projects using C, C++ and Python.
- **Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior** 
	- On-site internship at IIITM Gwalior and worked on A* Search Algorithm to understand communication between a robot and a UAV.
- **OpenStudy, Palo Alto**
	- The responsibilities included to actively promote the website and itâ€™s cause amongst the students and to guide them through the beginning steps for the website. Made sure the smooth following of Code of Conduct of OpenStudy. Also worked as a leader of OpenStudy Newsletter Programme for two editions as well as Designer in one edition.
