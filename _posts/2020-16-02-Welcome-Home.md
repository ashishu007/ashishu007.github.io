## About Me

I am Ashish, first year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.rgu.ac.uk/">Robert Gordon University</a> (RGU), Aberdeen, UK working under the supervision of <a href="https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/massie-stewart">Dr. Stewart Massie</a> in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). My research interest includes the use of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Deep Learning (DL) in NLP, specially finding ways to develop effective NLP systems for business processes with minimal labelled data. 

I completed my Bachelor's in Technology (BTech) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in June 2019 from <a href="https://www.iiitnr.ac.in/">Dr. SPM-International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur</a> (IIIT-NR), Chhattisgarh, India. 

Before starting the PhD at RGU, I also worked as an intern during my BTech final semester under the supervision of Dr. Stewart Massie at RGU. During that internship, I worked on the Information Extraction and Requirement Mapping from Regulatory Documents. It was an Scottish Oil and Gas Innovation Centre (OGIC) funded project in collaboration with a Scotland based start-up working on the automation of compliance management in Oil and Gas industry. This project outcome finally led to me getting a PhD offer under the same supervisor at RGU.


## Work Experience

## Non-Academic Interests and Achievements

During my Bachelor studies, I was involved into a lot of event organising, to name a few: Connaissance 2016 (Litrature-cum-Cultural Fest, IIIT-NR), Technovate 2018 (Techno-Cultural Fest, IIIT-NR), Industry-Academia Meet, 2017 (IIIT-NR). Before the start of 5th semester, I also used to participate in a lot of Youth Parliaments where once I won the best delegate award as well. I charied a few debates as moderator and speaker (more about them in my <a href="https://panditu2015.github.io/CV_Ashish_Upadhyay.pdf">CV</a>).
